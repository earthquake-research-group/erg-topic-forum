title: "How to use this site"
---

This site is the ERG Topic Forum (Earthquake Research Group, University of Melbourne). Content lives in GitHub and is rendered with **Quarto**.

## What is Quarto?

Quarto turns source files into a website.

- **.qmd** → Quarto Markdown (best for written notes)
- **.md** → Markdown (plain text formatting)
- **.ipynb** → Jupyter notebooks (best for tutorials / runnable demos)

## Add a new session from a local computer

### 1) Create a session from the template

```bash
SESSION="your-session-slug"
cp -R templates/session "sessions/$SESSION"
```

### 2) Edit the metadata

Open:

```bash
nano "sessions/$SESSION/index.qmd"
```

Set the YAML front matter at the top:

```yaml

author: "Your name"
date: 2026-03-20
categories: [paper-discussion, topic]
execute: false

## Notebook sessions (Jupyter)

Create a notebook session at:

```text
sessions/<session-slug>/index.ipynb
```

In the notebook, add this as the **first Markdown cell**:

```yaml

author: "Your name"
date: 2026-03-20
categories: [method-skill, python]
execute: false
jupyter: python3

## How the website builds

This repo uses **GitHub Actions** to build the website after each push to the default branch.

If you can see your change on GitHub, the site updates after the workflow finishes (Actions tab).

---

## Colab

Open any notebook in Colab (after it is committed and pushed to GitHub):

```text
https://colab.research.google.com/github/earthquake-research-group/erg-topic-forum/blob/main/sessions/<session-slug>/index.ipynb
```
