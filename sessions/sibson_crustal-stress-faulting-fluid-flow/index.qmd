## 3-slide summary

### Slide 1 — Context
- Relationship between crustal stress, faulting regime, and pore-fluid pressure
- What controls whether faults are strong or weak?

### Slide 2 — Key result

Effective stress (normal component):

$$
\sigma'_n = \sigma_n - P_f
$$

### Slide 3 — Why it matters for ERG
- Fluid pressure changes can trigger failure
- Transient permeability during seismicity
- Relevance to induced seismicity and reservoir systems

## Discussion questions

1. What observations would indicate a fault-valve cycle?
2. How important is near-lithostatic fluid pressure for earthquake nucleation?
3. How would this model appear in modern seismic + pressure datasets?
